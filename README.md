## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase SQL querying and performance analysis using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. In this project, we will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

## Objectives

- Use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
- Calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `EXTRACT()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`.
- Develop skills for performance analysis using SQL by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.

- ## SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset

The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:
- **User ID**
- **Question ID**
- **Points Earned**
- **Submission Timestamp**
- **Username**

This data allows us to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.

## SQL Problems and Questions

Here are the SQL problems that we will solve as part of this project:

### Q1. List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
- **Description**: Return the user name, total submissions, and total points earned by each user.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users with their submission count and total points.

### Q2. Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
- **Description**: For each day, calculate the average points earned by each user.
- **Expected Output**: A report showing the average points per user for each day.

### Q3. Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
- **Description**: Identify the top 3 users with the most correct submissions for each day.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.

### Q4. Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
- **Description**: Identify the top 5 users with the highest number of incorrect submissions.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.

### Q5. Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
- **Description**: Identify the top 10 users with the highest total points earned each week.
- **Expected Output**: A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week.

## Key SQL Concepts Covered

- **Aggregation**: Using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` to aggregate data.
- **Date Functions**: Using `EXTRACT()` and `TO_CHAR()` for manipulating dates.
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Using `CASE WHEN` to handle positive and negative submissions.
- **Ranking**: Using `DENSE_RANK()` to rank users based on their performance.
- **Group By**: Aggregating results by groups (e.g., by user, by day, by week).
